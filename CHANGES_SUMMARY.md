# Changes Summary

## Overview
Successfully removed the `LOCAL_FILE_PATH` constant and the `better-auth.txt` file, and fixed the MCP error `keyValidator._parse is not a function`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed File Dependencies
- ✅ Deleted `better-auth.txt` file
- ✅ Removed `LOCAL_FILE_PATH` constant from `index.js`
- ✅ Removed unused `fs` import from `index.js`

### 2. Fixed MCP Server Configuration
- ✅ Removed problematic `capabilities` configuration from `McpServer` constructor
- ✅ Updated server initialization to use proper MCP SDK configuration
- ✅ Fixed the `keyValidator._parse is not a function` error

### 3. Updated Resource Registration
- ✅ Replaced file-based resource with inline documentation content
- ✅ Updated `initResources` function to generate documentation content dynamically
- ✅ Changed resource URI from `file://better-auth.txt` to `better-auth://documentation`

### 4. Updated Tool Descriptions
- ✅ Removed all references to `better-auth.txt` from tool descriptions
- ✅ Updated tool descriptions to reference "Better Auth documentation" instead of the file

### 5. Updated Logging
- ✅ Removed reference to local file path in console output
- ✅ Updated success message to reflect the new implementation

## Technical Details

### MCP Error Fix
The error `keyValidator._parse is not a function` was caused by an incorrect `capabilities` configuration in the `McpServer` constructor. The fix involved:

1. Removing the `capabilities: { resources: {}, tools: {} }` configuration
2. Using the default MCP server configuration which properly handles capabilities

### Resource Implementation
Instead of reading from a local file, the server now:
1. Generates comprehensive Better Auth documentation content inline
2. Provides the same information through the MCP resource system
3. Maintains compatibility with existing tools

## Verification
- ✅ Server starts without errors
- ✅ MCP server initialization successful
- ✅ All tools and resources properly registered
- ✅ No remaining references to deleted file

## Benefits
1. **Reduced Dependencies**: No longer depends on external file
2. **Better Performance**: Content generated dynamically
3. **Improved Reliability**: No file I/O operations
4. **Cleaner Code**: Removed unnecessary file handling logic
5. **Fixed MCP Error**: Server now works correctly with MCP protocol

The MCP server is now fully functional and ready for use with Better Auth documentation and tools.
